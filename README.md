## JUnit tests

Writing tests is very import for a software developer and **unit test** allows developers to test the
smallest bits of their code that when put together makes a larger project/solution.

These tests allows developers find problems in smaller bits of code before testing the whole program and this also allows 
for easier bug detection as each code test in small units.

The first stage is to write a **failing test** then fix your code to **pass the test** then **refactor** the code and 
repeat the cycle.
